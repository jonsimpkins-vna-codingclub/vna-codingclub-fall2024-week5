# Fall 2024, Week 5

This week, we'll be learning about:

* For loops
* How to exit a loop (`break` out)
* How to skip to the next loop iteration (`continue` on along)

## Coding Challenge: Robot on a Dock

For the coding challenge, we're going to program a robot to
carry boxes onto a boat. Make sure not to fall in the water!
