# Fall 2024, Week 5

This week, we'll be learning about:

* For loops
* How to exit a loop (`break` out)

## Coding Challenge: Robot on an Island

For the coding challenge, we're going to program a robot to
climb safely onto a boat. Make sure not to fall in the water,
or run into anyone else on the island!
